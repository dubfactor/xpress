# LEARNING GOALS - WEEK 2

## 1. Learn CSS 

  1. [Introduction to CSS - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS)

  Please review the concepts covered in this Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) tutorial.  This is the one of the most authoritative, updated, and well planned material on the subject of CSS and fairly concise to come back to, after going through in-class lectures and demonstration.

  2. [Bonus Course - Learn HTML & CSS: How To Start Your Web Development - Bowen](https://www.udemy.com/how-i-landed-a-web-development-job-earned-5k-freelancing)

  Sign up for a free Udemy account, or use the one you already have.  Then sign up for this course, which offers some nice practical projects.

  Who is this for?

  Go through this course if you are not sure about your grasp of CSS fundamentals after reviewing MDN and in-class materials.  Go through it, time permitting, to solidify your skills in raw CSS.

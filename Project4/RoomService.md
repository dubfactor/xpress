# Project 4

## Learning Goal

  1. Use of HTML Forms
  
** Hotel Room Service ** 

A simple form page for a hotel that allows the guest to order a hot, delicious breakfast in the morning.

The drop down box next to “What time would you like to be served?” should display 6AM, 7AM, 8AM, 9AM and 10AM.

## Question A:

What color would you expect the item Sweet Halwa to show as and why?

<img src="images/1.png" width=45%>
<img src="images/2.png" width=45% style="padding-left:10px;">

## Question B:

What color would you expect the item "Sausage" to show as and why?

<div>
   <img src="images/a.png" width=90%>
</div>
<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;">
    <img src="images/b.png" width=90%>
</div>


## Solution here please ...

### 
The list item of Sweet Halwa is 2, Milk is item 1.
2 is even.
Sweet Halwa will be red.
<!-- no. did you test?   -->

the id of must-buy is referenced in css file as #must-buy. sausage is must-buy. It's text color will be blue
<!-- this refers to id being more selective in css.  you need
to talk about that specificity -->

<!-- 0.25 credit for picking blue in 2nd example -->

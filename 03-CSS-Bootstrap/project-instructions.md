### Week 3 Projects - Bootstrap

**Instructions:**

Your task is to re-create from scratch the websites that you see from the screenshots. Each project is it’s own individual website which may have one or more pages. Detailed instructions for each project are listed below. Good luck!

#### Project #1: Landing page

This is a simple, single page website built with bootstrap.

This website should have the background fill the entire screen, except for the navigation bar at the top. The nav bar has a logo on the left side, and a login/registration form on the right side.

#### Project #2: The Social

**A website with three web pages for a fictional social network called ‘The Social’.**

There is a homepage, an about page, and a contact page. Each page has a navigation bar and footer.

On the about page: the columns in the middle section should remain side by side on large, medium, and small screens. The columns should stack on top of each other on an extra small screen.

On the contact page: the columns for the form field and the text need to be side by side on large and mediums screens, and then stack on top of each other when it’s viewed on a small and extra small screen.

The footer (on all pages) should have its columns side by side on all sizes, except for extra small. It should stack on top of each other on an extra small screen.

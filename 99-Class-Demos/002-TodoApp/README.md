## Instructions

This is the front-end ToDo app that is used as a basis for development of
the full stack ToDo app.

1. Please review this code as we would make this a basis for further development.

1. You may wish to copy this code to your repository folder, and edit it there using 
you Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice, e.g. VSCode.  

1. Make sure that your back-end rest API is deployed to a publicly accessible location.  I 
suggest deploying it to Heroku or AWS.  Follow instructions provided in class to deploy to
Heroku.
